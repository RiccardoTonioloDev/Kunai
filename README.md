- [For VigenerÃ¨](./ciphers.py)
- [For counting words](./count_words.py) and [for counting frequencies of chars](./frequency_counter.py)
- [To search for words in a string](./search_words.py)
- [A function to shift single char by a char](./shifting_by_key.py)
- [To encrypt and decrypt the xor](./xor_enc_dec.py)
    > **WARNING:** please understand that this is an interpretation of the xor encryption/decryption algorithm. Your situation may require a different intrepretation of it.
