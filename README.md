# Kunai
 A library of functions for cryptoanalysis, (enc/dec)ryption, (enc/dec)oding, reverse engineering, pwning, GOT hijacking, ROP chains hijacking. The name is inspired from the library [ctf-katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana) by [John Hammond](https://github.com/JohnHammond).

- [For encoding/deconding (b64, HEX, binToString)](./encode_decode.py)
- [For char replacement](./char_replacer.py)
- [For VigenerÃ¨](./ciphers.py)
- [For counting words frequencies](./count_words.py) and [for counting frequencies of chars](./frequency_counter.py)
- [To search for words in a string](./search_words.py)
- [A function to shift single char by a char](./shifting_by_key.py)
- [To encrypt and decrypt the xor](./xor_enc_dec.py)
    > **WARNING:** please understand that this is an interpretation of the xor encryption/decryption algorithm. Your situation may require a different intrepretation of it.
